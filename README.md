> **"Code assistants often fail because they read code, but don't read the error logs. CodeSensei reads both."**

## 🚀 Project Overview
CodeSensei is a specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of **Qwen 2.5 Coder**, fine-tuned to act as an automated reliability engineer. Unlike standard coding assistants that blindly guess fixes based on syntax, CodeSensei consumes **multi-modal input (Source Code + Runtime Stack Traces)** to perform root cause analysis and precise patch generation.

Achieved a **24% improvement in Fix Accuracy (Pass@1)** compared to the base model on the `PyTrace-Hard` holdout set.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
1.  **Data Pipeline:** Constructed a dataset of 2,000 `{buggy_code, error_trace, fix}` triplets using `Nikitosh/buggy-code-pairs` augmented with synthetic runtime traces generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
2.  **Fine-Tuning:** Trained using **Unsloth** (QLoRA) on a Tesla T4 GPU to minimize memory footprint while maximizing instruction adherence.
3.  **Inference Engine:** Quantized to GGUF for low-latency CPU inference via **Ollama**.

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks
| Metric | Base Qwen 2.5 Coder | CodeSensei (Fine-Tuned) | Lift |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Pass@1 (Syntax Fix)** | 62% | **88%** | 🔺 +26% |
| **Trace Alignment** | 45% | **92%** | 🔺 +47% |
| **Hallucination Rate** | 18% | **4%** | 🔻 -14% |

*Note: "Trace Alignment" measures how accurately the model cites the specific line number mentioned in the stack trace.*
